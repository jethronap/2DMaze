# 2DMaze

>An application that finds the shortest path given a maze, a start point and a goal. 
>It uses two different algorithmic flavours Dijkstra and AStar Search.
>
>You can use one of the mazes provided in [test_data](https://github.com/jethronap/2DMaze/tree/master/src/test_data) folder. Or try making one yourself.
>
>#####**Note**: If invalid filename is given the application exits.
>
>Acceptable maze format:
>
>                       n_rows = your number of rows
>                       n_cols = your number of cols
>                       0, O
>                       1, X
>                       2, X
>                       3, O
>                       ...
>
>On the left column is the zero-based numbering of cells and should start from the bottom left corner of your maze and continue upwards.
>
>Whereas on the right the blocked flag. Use `O` for open `X` for closed.
>
>See example below to understand how cell numbering is supposed to be.
